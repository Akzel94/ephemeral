msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:19
msgid ""
"1️⃣ Always incognito. From the second you open an Ephemeral window until you "
"close it (or hit the Erase button), Ephemeral is in private browsing mode. "
"That means history, cookies, local storage, passwords, etc. are all blown "
"away as soon as you leave."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:20
msgid ""
"2️⃣ Contained. Every Ephemeral window is a separate instance of the browser "
"engine. This means pages are kept separate from one another. Sign into a "
"service in one window, and other Ephemeral windows will have no idea you’re "
"signed in."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:21
msgid ""
"3️⃣ No third-party cookies. Out of the box, Ephemeral blocks cookies from "
"third-party sources. This cuts down on advertising cookies and other "
"unwanted forms of cross-site tracking."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:22
msgid ""
"4️⃣ No telemetry. Ephemeral does not touch the network until you explicitly "
"load a web page or perform a search. Even then, no usage data is ever "
"collected—I have no idea what you do with Ephemeral, and I don't want to "
"know!"
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:23
msgid ""
"Ephemeral also uses DuckDuckGo — the search engine that doesn’t track you — "
"by default to avoid as much Google tracking as possible."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:24
msgid ""
"What if you run into a site compatibility issue due to the tracking "
"prevention, or if you want to sign into a site using another browser’s saved "
"passwords? Ephemeral has you covered: just hit your other browser’s icon in "
"the header and the current page is opened up there."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:25
msgid ""
"The best part of Ephemeral comes when you use it as your default browser: "
"make privacy a habit by opening links in a private browser by default, "
"knowing you can always jump back into a less private browser with one click."
msgstr ""

#: data/com.github.cassidyjames.ephemeral.appdata.xml.in:26
msgid ""
"Remember, Ephemeral and any browser's incognito or private mode can only do "
"so much: they mitigate some tracking and don't store data on your device, "
"but they won't stop your ISP, government, or determined websites from "
"tracking you. For the best protection, always use a VPN."
